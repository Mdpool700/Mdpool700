Hi Mark the Plumber here. I'm looking for ways to make my job easier using software.
Plumbing design software to be exact. Acutally I have been working on and using a crude version of my software for 17 years. 
Now it's time to make it better by updating it to newer technology. 
I look forward to colaberating with you and maybe helping with your projects!
Mark
